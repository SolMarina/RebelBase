Coding Challenge

Instructions: Please refer to the mockups provided below. Create HTML, CSS and JS for the following single page application. This page has two components. Component one is on the left which has a tab navigation bar. Component two is on the right side which contains a list of items that can be selected using a radio button and rearranged using drag and drop. Additionally the items on the right have a form with a date and time picker that shows when selected. There is a select all button which selects all the items, and when selected it should change to "unselect all". The page should be responsive for browsers and mobile.

For JS developers, please focus on functionality of the components (seamless drag and dropping, radio button selection, forms, buttons)
